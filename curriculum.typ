- Passionate for lower level concepts such as instruction sets, specifically ARM32 and AMD64, memory and system internals.
- Understanding of networking concepts including ISO/OSI, DNS and subnetting.
I made cheats for single player games with assembly code injections into the game's process code in memory.
=== Programming
- Two years of experience with Go making CLI tools and secure JWT/OAuth2 APIs using libraries such as Chi and Goose!
- Deep understanding of API security vulnerabilities based on statistics(meaning BOLA, XSS, CSRF and more).
I made a secure and extensively audited authentication API from scratch.
=== Systems
- Extended usage and hardening of Linux(Arch, Artix and Debian) and basic understanding of OpenBSD and Windows Server.
- Practical usage of Docker(including Compose) and basic understanding of Kubernetes.
- Deep understanding of Cloud Architecture on AWS, Azure and Tencent, also using Terraform!
- Understanding of DevOps for efficent CI/CD pipelines!
I have been using Windows and Arch Linux for a long time, had an homeserver with self hosted privacy oriented apps and worked on various AWS deployments one trying to emulate Riot Games architecture on a smaller scale! \
